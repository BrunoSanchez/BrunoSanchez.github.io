## Bruno SÃ¡nchez

I am an astronomer working at Duke University trying to understand our universe and its evolution through the discovery and characterization of astrophysical transient events.  

My scientific contributions are mainly in the time domain astronomy field, and include image analysis and Machine Learning, as well as statistical studies with observational data from telescopes around the world.
