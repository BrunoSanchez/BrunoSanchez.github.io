# About me


>I am an **astronomer** working at the Centre de Physique des Particules de
Marseille, a CNRS laboratory, trying to understand our universe and its
evolution through the discovery and characterization of specific astrophysical
transient events called Type Ia Supernovae.

My scientific contributions are mainly in the time domain astronomy field, and
include difference image analysis and Machine Learning, as well as statistical
studies with observational data from telescopes around the world, including the
final data release of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program [DES-SN5YR](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...975....5S/abstract).

## Current Position

Since 2023 I am a member of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Alert Production
team, specifically working on difference image analysis algorithms, performance
characterization, and scientific validation. I work everyday developing
software, using the LSST Software Stack, writing tests, squashing bugs and
improving the system performance.

## Research topics

>My main interests include Cosmology, time-domain astronomy with transient events
>and periodical variability, image analysis as well as applications of Machine
>Learning in these research areas.

Additionally I have worked with _Gravitational Wave Astronomy_, mostly related
with Electromagnetic/Optical Counterparts to Compact Binary Merger GW events.

I enjoy creating different data visualizations, and I have experience in Feature
Engineering for optimizing Machinge Learning models performance.

## Skills

* I have a PhD. in Astronomy, and I am able to create and use mathematical and
physical models, to describe and explain data from diverse experiments.

* Additionally, I have skills in software developement using Python, R as well as
SQL and Fortran.

* I work everyday with software from the LSST Stack, and I am an expert in
analyzing data from the Vera C. Rubin telescope, that uses the largest camera
for astronomy in the world.

* I posses the know-how on scientific data-analysis pipeline design using Object
Oriented Programming, software design patterns, as well as diverse workflows for
Extract-Transform-Load processes.

* I have experience applying Machine Learning models to astronomical data, using
both supervised and non-supervised learning. I have know-how to implement both
feature based ML as well as Neural Networks that don't depend on features (such
Deep Convolutional Networks, Auto-Encoders, LSTM networks and diverse types of
embeddings).

* I am also able to optimize numeric calculus for a wide range of problems using
a tool sets involving many technologies, such as Spark, Dask, Tensorflow, Keras, etc.

* As an advocate of good practices of software developing I use Git version control
techniques for collaborating, and I am proficient in software testing as well,
using techniques like unit-testing, continuous integration, ticket-based work
tracking, code reviews in pull requests, and property based testing.
